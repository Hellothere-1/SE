 * This script allowes you to communicate or chat through the ingame antenna, using the build-jn com feature.
 * If you tried the antenna com feature before using this script, you surely noticed, that there are alot of
 * problems with antennas und their communication. This script will help you communicate through antennas, with
 * build in security functions as temporal broadcasting, names and factions checks and a failsafe connection 
 * system, which ensures a connections and reports, if a message is lost or could not be transmitted.
 * 
 * The build-in chat system has to be used by a human user, the other parts of this script can also be used by
 * other programs, to create drones, data transmitting, help calls or whatever you would like to do with it.
 *
